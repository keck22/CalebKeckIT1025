# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to teach us the difference between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers and how to convert them, as well as learning more about how computure hardware processes what a programer imputs into it. 

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
Latency is how long it takes for the hard drives read and write head to get to the physical place where the data is stored, where transfer rates is the time it takes to transfer the data from the disk media 
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
SSD store data instantly on accessible memory while a hard drive stores data on mechanical platters
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
More or faster ram, increases the speeds at which memory transfers information

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
64 bit data paths can handle more data at once than 32 but versions

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
The control unit handles the Arithmetic Logic Unit and handles conditional logic 

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
A CPU executes instructions that make up a computers program, an input is what a programmer plugs into the program, the output is what the the final product that the CPU processes. 

## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.  
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? the truth table refers what the imput is and what is given as the output. The NAND truth table is when one or more but not all imputs are true then the output is false, AND gate is can only be true when all imputs are true if not it is false. 

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. Ethics in design concerns moral behavior and responsible choices in the practice of design. It guides how designers work with clients, colleagues, and the end users of products, how they conduct the design process, how they determine the features of products, and how they assess the ethical significance or moral worth of the products that result from the activity of designing.

# Data Representation
## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
* Decimal - the base 10 number system, 10 symbols
* Binary - more complex base 2 number system, 2 symbols, bases of all modern computing
* Hexadecimal - a base 16 symbol system, numbers 0-9 and letters A-F
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file) and save to a file named DecimalConversion and upload to your lab folder. 
* decimal number 211 converts to binary number 11010011 - screenshot can be found in lab folder

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Convert the binary representation: 10110101 to decimal and save your work to a file named BinaryConversion and upload to the lab folder. 
Binary number 10110101 is converted to decimal number 181 and a screenshot can be found in my lab folder
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 
* #ab00ff is a color made up of 61% red and 100% blue on a RGB color space. 
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 
* I think this color would be problematic for people who are color blind or deal with a form of color blindness because it is comprised of two colors that are most found to be hard for people with color blindness the most. I think a color that has less red and blue and more green in it should be considred, or at least a color that has similar red and blue percentages. 

# Conclusion
Explain what you learnt from this lab
I learned an aray of things including, cpu purposes in computures, how more ram allows a computure to run faster, how to covert binary, and hexadecimal numbers.
