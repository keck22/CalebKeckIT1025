# Executive summary

This lab is a introduction to the basic principles of technology works. We will be disscusing Information Systems, How Github works, and how we benefit from using services like these.

# Information System Componentsâ€¯

Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

* Hardware - Hardware is the physical things we can touch, such as the numbers to put your pin in, the processors that run the ATM, and the touch screen that you can choose what you would like to do.
* Software - Software is the information that programers create to let the ATM understand what you are given. An example of this would be when the ATM asks to insert your card. 
* Data - Data can be interpreted as facts such as who's debit card it is, where they live, and how much money is in their account.
* People - People are still important to an ATM for the example of losing your debit card, you may have to talk to someone to answer a few questions in order to get another debit card sent out to your house.

# Github

Client-Server archietecture means that users are able to log into their account to access data on their personal computure from servers that are connected to LAN. This allows me to use github for homework, save my homework where it is sent back through the server and allowed to be accessed by my proffesor. 

Cloud computing allows me to plug in new information on my PC, and be able to see that new information on any PC that I log into. Cloud computing is also used in google docs, and apple devices for photos.

# Conclusion
 One thing I struggled with was being able to move and rename things in my first repository, I messed up on it the first time and ended up deleting it and restarting the whole thing, I am sure there is a more simplistic way but I do not know how to do it.
